1. mkdir answers
2. touch answers.txt
3. nano answers.txt
4. ~/downloads/envanalysis/assignment-1/assignment-1/answers/ answers.txt
5. ls -a
6. use ls and then the absolute path to the directory/files you wish to list
7. rm is a dangerous command because it deletes files and makes them unrecoverable. An example of unintended consequences resulting from this is that you could accidentally delete a file you did not want to delete, and would then be unable to get it back
8. mkdir results (while in answers directory)
9. nano my_script.sh, then I input the code from the assignment sheet
10. chmod 755 my_script.sh
11. (from the answers directory) cd ~/downloads/envanalysis/assignment-1/assignment-1/data
12. wc -w * | sort -n | tail -n 3 | head -n 1
13. for csv in *.csv
>do
> ~/downloads/envanalysis/assignment-1/assignment-1/answers/results/my_script.sh $csv
>done
14. multiple commands:
	1. mkdir unzipped-files
	2. mv *.zip unzipped-files
	3. for zip in *.zip
	>do
	>unzip $zip
	>done
15. for zip in *.zip
>do
>rm $zip
>done
16. cp *200*.csv ~/downloads/envanalysis/assignment-1/assignment-1/answers/results
